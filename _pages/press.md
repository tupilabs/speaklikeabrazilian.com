## About Speak Like A Brazilian

Speak Like A Brazilian is a public website, licensed under a Creative
Commons license. It was created in 2012 by Bruno P. Kinoshita so that
he could help an Irish friend living in Brazil to understand better
what was spoken in supermarkets, drugstores, pubs, and other places
where colloquial Brazilian Portuguese is used.

The website is hosted on GitHub, and built with Open Source libraries.
The source code of the whole website is also available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/tupilabs/speaklikeabrazilian.com/).

Planned future work includes semantic web and linked data, providing
resources such as data that can be imported by users to create dictionaries,
machine translation tools, or perform other natural language processing work.

The website name can be abbreviated to SLBR. At the moment we are serving
