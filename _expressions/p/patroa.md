      The translation for “patroa” is “boss” (female). It may be used with
      a similar meaning to [patrão](/p/patrão), just showing respect and
      humility, but in most cases this expression is used by a man, speaking
      with other men about his wife or girlfriend.
    example: |
      - Jogar futebol esse Domingo no campo do Lauzane?
      - Só se a **patroa** deixar.
