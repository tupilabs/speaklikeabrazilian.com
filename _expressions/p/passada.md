      A piece of fabric or clothes that have been ironed are “passadas“. The verb
      for ironing clothes is “passar“, and you “passa suas roupas“ (iron your clothes).
    example: |
      - Você passou essa roupa? Elá [tá](/t/tá) toda amassada.
      - Passei, eu só uso roupa **passada**. Deve ser o tecido.

      This word means that some has passed, or is already past, or has been ironed. But it
      can also mean that something is unbelievable, that you simply cannot believe it.
      
      It gives emphasis that some situation is simply impossible to be accepted. That someone
      did something that was really unexpected, and that there is simply no explanation for that.
      
      It is normally used by women, and it is not very common to hear men using it.
    example: |
      - Amiga, o Tonho terminou com você? E ainda foi ficar com a Eloá? Não acredito,
        eu [tô](/t/tô) **passada**.
      
      - Amigo, eu fiquei **passado** ao ouvir sobre o Tonho e a Eli.
