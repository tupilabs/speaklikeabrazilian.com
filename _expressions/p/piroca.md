      Slang for dick, penis. The difference to the other many other words with similar meaning
      in Brazilian Portuguese, is that "piroca" may sound like bragging about one's own penis.
      A "piroca" sounds stronger than a "pipi", got it?
    example: |
      - Pega aqui na minha **piroca**, seu medroso!
      
      - Olha que piroca!
