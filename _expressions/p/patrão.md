      The translation for “patrão” is “boss”, but it is used too
      by waiters and other employees like doormen or people showing
      humility. It is an affectionate way to address someone wanting
      to show respect, or let the other person feel important.
    example: |
      - Oi **patrão**, o mesmo de ontem [pra levar](/p/pra+levar)?
