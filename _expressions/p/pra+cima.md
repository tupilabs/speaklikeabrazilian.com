      To go after someone, or to go at someone. This is normally used in soccer and other sports,
      when people say for a player to attack or defend.
      
      Can also be used in other situations to motivate someone in doing something.
    example: |
      - Olha, aquela menina não parou de olhar pro Miguel.
      - Oi, Miguel! Vai **pra cima** dela que acho que ela gostou de você!
      
      - **Pra cima** deles, Pele!
