      “Gratidão“ means “gratitude”. Lately, it has been used when replying to an act of
      kindness, especially online in social media, for instance. Or as a hashtag to
      indicate someone is grateful for something.
    example: |
      - São Paulo, dia ensolarado en Julho! **#gratidao**
      
      - Amor, eu queria expressar minha gratidão pela sua companhia todos estes anos.
