      To cross your legs. This normally means to cross a single leg over the other. The
      expression can be used to describe both men and women. And cross-legged would be
      translated as "com as pernas cruzadas" (with the legs crossed).
      
      The act of crossing legs is called "cruzada de pernas".
      
      And the opposite of crossing your legs (uncrossing), is "descruzar as pernas".
    example: |
      - Eu acho muito chique homem que **cruza as pernas** quando senta.
      
      - Cuidado quando for **cruzar as pernas** que tem um homem estranho sentado na sua frente.
