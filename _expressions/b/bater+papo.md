      This means "to chat" with someone. Either in person or virtually. The old online
      web chats were called "bate-papos", or "salas de bate-papo" (sala means "room").
      
      In old Portuguese (XIV century and before) it had another meaning, of something
      that had an adverse or ill effect on somebody. But in modern times it got a new
      meaning of to converse, to talk with somebody.
      
      The word "papo" itself can also be used alone, which means conversation, and can
      be applied with other verbs giving it a similar meaning (e.g. "ter um papo"),
      although "bater um papo" is still the most common form of the expression.
      
      The "papo" is the name of the chicken crop, the part of the chicken that holds the
      food it eats before passing it forward in its digestive system. Also the name of
      the frog sac. In informal Portuguese, "papo" can mean someone's belly or stomach,
      or even the region under the chin (the "papada").
    example: |
      - Eu já falei pro Senhor que horário de trabalho é pra trabalhar, e não pra ficar
        **batendo papo**.
      
      - Ih, ontem eu fiquei até tarde no maior “papo” com o [boy](/u/boy/).
      
      - João, precisamos conversar. Você pode passar aqui a noite pra gente **bater um papo**?
