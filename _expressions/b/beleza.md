      “Beleza” literally means ”Beauty”. As in “Sua beleza me
      encanta. A sua voz e o teu calor!”.
      
      However, it is very likely that you will hear more often
      “Beleza” being used with similar meaning to “Okay”, “Okeydokey”,
      “Cool” or as ”How are you doing?”.
      
      Abbreviated as “blz” in texting and online. 
    example: |
      - [Eae](/e/eae/), beleza? (Yo, how's it going?)
