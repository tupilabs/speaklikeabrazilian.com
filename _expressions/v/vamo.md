      Common misspelling of "vamos" (let's go). In normal conversation, in rare cases "vamos" is
      used, but instead people prefer to use "vamo" as it is simpler to say and connect with other
      words.
    example: |
      - **Vamo** ver um filme?
      
      - É semana que vem que **vamo** pra praia?
