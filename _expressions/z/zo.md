      Abbreviation of “Zona Oeste”, the western part of a city, state, country. In São Paulo it's
      quite common to use it as the city is divided into four zones (northern, southern, eastern, western)
      and the city centre.
    example: |
      - Aonde fica Perdizes?
      - Fica na **ZO**.
