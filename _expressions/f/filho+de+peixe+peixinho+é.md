      Like father, like son. The translation for the Brazilian Portuguese version
      is “son of fish, a little fish (fry, fingerling) is”. It is used in the same
      way as with the English expression, to point that someone is similar to
      somebody else because they are of the same family, kind, taste, etc.
      
      It can also be abbreviated to just the first part, “filho de peixe”. When
      talking about a girl or woman, the masculine version can still be used, or
      it can simply be translated to “filha de peixe, peixinha é”.
    example: |
      - O Éderson engravidou a vizinha!
      - Igual o pai dele! **Filho de peixe**, [né](/n/né/)?
