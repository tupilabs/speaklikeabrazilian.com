        Speaking nonsense. It's related to [lé com lé, cré com cré](/l/lé+com+lé+cré+com+cré/).
        Whereas you have each of their pair in the expression “lé com lé, cré com cré”,
        in this case we have they mismatched, “lé com cré”, which is used to mean that
        something is wrong, not making sense.
    example: |
      - Pare de falar **lé com cré**.
