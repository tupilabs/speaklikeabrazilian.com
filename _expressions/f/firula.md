  - definition: "To do more than necessary for something to happen.\nIn speech, it can mean \"beating around the bush\", or ommiting facts to avoid a topic.\nIn design, it can mean useless decorative elements that add no value or function.\nIn software development, it can mean code that serves no purpose other than looking nice.\nIn sports, it can mean actions that only embelishes plays and don't result in any advancement (like a goal or similar)."
    example: "— Pare de adicionar firulas no design, isso s\u00F3 complica a produ\u00E7\u00E3o e n\u00E3o adiciona nada de \u00FAtil\n— O jogador fica de firulas e, no fim, n\u00E3o faz nenhum gol."
