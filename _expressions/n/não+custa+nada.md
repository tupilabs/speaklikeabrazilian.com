      The exact same text may appear with two different meanings. One, the
      literal meaning, that “something does not cost anything”, with cost
      being the actual price.
      
      The second meaning is a very common expression, that means that
      “it doesn't hurt”, “never hurts”, that something is useful or
      helpful.
    example: |
      - [Vamo](/v/vamo) ver se a Tia Joana precisa de alguma coisa antes de sairmos?
      - Vamos, até porque **não custa nada** a gente ter certeza, né? Ela estava tão dodói hoje de manhã.
