      This is a funny (and very informal) Brazilian Portuguese expression, that translates
      as “If you in hell, you may as well hug the devil“.
      
      Its meaning is that if you are already in a tough situation, but there is any way
      to have some fun, then you might as well.
      
      For instance, you are fired from your job, but you always wanted an opportunity to
      tell human resources about some mismanagement in your department. Now that you are
      fired, you might as well — so: "tá no inferno, abraça o capeta".
      
      The "tá" in the expression is the abbreviated form of “está“, from the verb
      “estar“. See [ta](/t/tá/) for more.
    example: |
      - Nossa, aqui só tem homem feio.
      - Ai amiga, já viemos até aqui né? **Tá no inferno, abraça o capeta**.
