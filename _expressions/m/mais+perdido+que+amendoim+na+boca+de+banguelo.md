      This is a funny expression that translates to “someone is as lost as a peanut
      inside a toothless mouth”. And the meaning is exactly what one may expect, it
      is used to point when someone is lost in the sense of not knowing what they are
      doing, or without a direction in their life. It may also mean simply lost, as
      someone lost in a labyrinth, in a mall, parking lot, etc..
    example: |
      - O Juca comprou duas motos ontem.
      - Esse tá **mais perdido que amendoim na boca de banguelo**. Não tem dinheiro pra
        comer mas fica comprando moto.
